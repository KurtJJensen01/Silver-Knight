# Silver Night

**Silver Night** is a 2D stage-based combat game developed by [Kurt J. Jensen](https://github.com/KurtJJensen01) as a senior project. This project was built completely from scratch â€” starting with no prior game development experience. Every aspect, from scripting to gameplay logic to design, was learned and implemented during the development process.

## Project Overview

Silver Night is a wave-based 2D combat game where the player fights enemies in self-contained stages. Once all enemies in a stage are defeated, the player moves to the next. The game emphasizes clean combat mechanics, smooth control, and structured level progression.

Built using the **Unity game engine** and scripted in **C#**, the project demonstrates practical knowledge of:
- Enemy AI and hitboxes
- Health and damage systems
- Game state management (win/lose/progress)
- Mouse-based attack mechanics
- Responsive movement and player feedback
- Scene transitions and UI implementation

## Features

- Tight 2D player controls
- Left-click melee combat system
- Multiple combat stages with increasing difficulty
- Enemy logic and attack behavior
- Health tracking and basic UI
- Pause and resume menu system

## Installation

To run the game locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KurtJJensen01/Silver-Night.git

## Notes on Repository

This repository uses a `.gitignore` configured for Unity projects, which excludes:
- Unity-generated folders (`Library/`, `Temp/`, `Obj/`)
- Build output directories (`Build/`)
- User-specific settings files

Make sure to open the project in Unity and build it before running, as these generated files are not included in the repository.
